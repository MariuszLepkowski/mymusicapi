# ðŸŽµ mymusicapi

**mymusicapi** is a RESTful web service built with **Django REST Framework**, providing CRUD operations, filtering, and search functionality for a collection of music albums.

Designed as part of a **portfolio project**, this API demonstrates modern backend development practices â€” including containerization with Docker, automated testing, and CI with GitHub Actions.

### Tech Stack

- **Python 3.12**
- **Django 5 / Django REST Framework**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Docker & docker-compose**
- **Pytest + Factory Boy**
- **GitHub Actions (CI)**
- **drf-spectacular** for automatic API documentation (Swagger / Redoc)

---

## Project Status

**Stage 1 â€“ Completed**

The first milestone of the project is complete, focusing on the **Public Albums API** with the following features:
- Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Filtering, search, and ordering
- Pagination support
- Random album endpoint
- CSV-based data seeding
- Automated testing and continuous integration (GitHub Actions)
- OpenAPI documentation via Swagger & ReDoc

Currently, the project runs locally via Docker and is not yet deployed to production.
Deployment to a cloud environment (e.g. **AWS**, **Render**, or **DigitalOcean**) is planned for a later phase.

### Summary

This repository represents the **first phase of a larger music collection API platform**.
It demonstrates clean REST architecture, Docker-based deployment, automated testing, and modern API documentation â€” serving as a portfolio project and a foundation for future feature expansion.


---

### Continuous Integration

[![CI](https://github.com/MariuszLepkowski/mymusicapi/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MariuszLepkowski/mymusicapi/actions)

---

## Installation & Setup

This project is fully containerized and runs via **Docker Compose**.
It includes a Django REST API backend and a PostgreSQL database service.

---

### Run the Application


### 1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/MariuszLepkowski/mymusicapi
cd mymusicapi
```

### 2. Build and start the containers
```sh
docker-compose up --build
```
## After successful startup, visit:
- Albums API: http://localhost:8000/api/albums/
- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/api/schema/swagger-ui/
- ReDoc documentation: http://localhost:8000/api/schema/redoc/

#### To stop all containers:
```sh
docker-compose down
```
### 3. Set up environment variables

All environment variables are managed via the .env file.

Copy the example environment file and fill in your own keys:
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```
All environment variables are managed via the .env file.

Example:

    DJANGO_DEBUG=True
    POSTGRES_DB=mymusicapi
    POSTGRES_USER=postgres
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
    POSTGRES_HOST=db
    POSTGRES_PORT=5432

The docker-compose.yml file automatically provisions a PostgreSQL container and applies these settings.

### 4. Apply database migrations
Before using the API, make sure the database schema is created:
```sh
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```
This will apply all existing Django migrations and prepare the database tables.

### 5. Create a superuser (optional)
If you want to access the Django admin panel, create a superuser account:
```sh
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Follow the prompts to set a username, email, and password.
Once created, visit:
- Django Admin: http://localhost:8000/admin/


### 6. Run Tests

You can run all tests inside the container:
```sh
docker-compose exec web pytest
```

Test results and coverage reports will be displayed in the console.


## Useful commands
```sh
# Rebuild containers (after code or dependency changes)
docker-compose up --build

# Apply database migrations
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate

# Access Django shell
docker-compose exec web python manage.py shell
```
